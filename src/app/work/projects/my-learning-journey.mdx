## Overview

Taking on Grant Collins' practical course on building a virtual corporate environment and simulating attack and defense scenarios was an eye-opening journey. This project was not just about setting up a network but also about expanding my knowledge through further research into real-world enterprise security.

## Key Areas Explored

### **Corporate Network Landscape**
A typical enterprise environment consists of several critical components:
- **Directory Services Server**: Set up Active Directory (AD) for user authentication and DNS for network name resolution.
- **Email Server**: Used Postfix but researched Microsoft Exchange for enterprise email security.
- **Client Machines**: Windows Enterprise or Linux workstations acting as endpoints.
- **Security Infrastructure**: Explored SIEM (Wazuh) and EDR solutions for real-time monitoring and defense.

### **Enterprise Security Tools and Technologies**

#### **Windows Server: The Backbone of Corporate Networks**
- **Active Directory (AD)**: Managed user permissions and access controls.
- **DNS & DHCP**: Automated network communications.
- **Group Policy (GPO), Hyper-V, and Windows Defender**: Researched their impact on security and management.

#### **Enterprise Email Security**
- **Postfix**: Used for mail transfer but lacked advanced security features.
- **Microsoft Exchange**: Industry-standard solution offering MFA, encryption, and phishing protection.

#### **Security Infrastructure: SIEM & EDR**
- **SIEM (Wazuh)**: Analyzed logs, detected anomalies, and generated alerts.
- **EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)**: Monitored devices, isolated threats, and provided forensic analysis.

## Simulated Cyberattack & Defense
Conducted an attack simulation to understand how cyber threats unfold:
1. **Reconnaissance** – Gathered intelligence using scanning techniques.
2. **Initial Access** – Used phishing and exploits to gain entry.
3. **Lateral Movement & Privilege Escalation** – Attempted to navigate the network and gain admin privileges.
4. **Data Exfiltration** – Tested detection methods for unauthorized data access.
5. **Persistence** – Explored backdoor techniques for maintaining access.

## Challenges and Learnings
One major takeaway was recognizing that misconfigured on-premises setups contribute significantly to cloud security risks. Research from Gartner estimates that **99% of cloud breaches through 2025 will result from customer misconfigurations**, reinforcing the importance of understanding foundational IT infrastructure to enhance cybersecurity defenses.

Additionally, effective collaboration between security teams, IT admins, and developers is essential for securing enterprise environments.

## Outcome
This hands-on experience reinforced cybersecurity principles and expanded my knowledge of attack and defense methodologies. Whether securing networks or investigating incidents, the insights gained from this project have strengthened my ability to handle real-world security challenges.
